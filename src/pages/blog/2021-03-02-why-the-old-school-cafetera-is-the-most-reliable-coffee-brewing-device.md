I mean this is where I write something very insightful and useful to society right? Well, wrong. Here is my bias filled perspective on making great coffee. It all starts with selecting the right bean. Then, taking the time to grind your beans in small fresh batches. Lastly, throw them in an old-school brewer that uses nothing but a gas fired flame to brew a great cup of coffee - oh and don't leave it on the stove for too long, you barbarian.
